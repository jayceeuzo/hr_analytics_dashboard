# HR Analytics Dashboard

## Overview
This project involved building an **HR Analytics Dashboard** using Power BI, designed to provide insightful visualizations of employee data. Prior to creating the dashboard, I uploaded raw CSV data files to an SQL Server to simulate real-world business data practices, as data in organizations is often accessed via servers. This approach allowed for direct querying from SQL, adding a layer of realism to the project.

## Key Features and Visualizations

1. **Data Connection and Transformation**
   - Data was imported from an SQL Server into Power BI, providing a streamlined workflow from data source to visualization.
   - Data transformations and cleaning were handled within Power BI to ensure accuracy and readiness for visualization.

2. **Hiring and Demographic Trends**
   - **Employees Hired by Year, Ethnicity, Gender, and Field of Study:** Offers a clear picture of hiring trends and diversity metrics across years, roles, and demographics.

3. **Salary Analysis**
   - **Salary Distribution by Job Role and Education Level:** Visualizes total salary investment and average salary by educational attainment, providing insights into compensation practices.

4. **Department and Job Role Insights**
   - **Hiring by Department and Job Role:** Breaks down hires by department and role, highlighting hiring focus areas.
   - **Sum of Salary and Number of Employees by Job Role:** Assesses total employee count and salary per role, revealing high-investment areas.

5. **Performance and Employee Satisfaction**
   - **Ratings by Level and Manager Ratings by Department & Job Role:** Shows performance levels across job roles, helping identify areas of excellence and improvement.
   - **Employee Satisfaction by Level:** Measures job satisfaction, work-life balance, and other factors affecting employee happiness.
